const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

fruits.length // .length at the end of ANY array

const numbers = [7, 44, 18, 4, 6, 5, 5486830.1584, 15, 27, 64, 4, 5, 24, -13];

console.log(numbers.length)

// you can do this off an array literal too but its not normal

console.log([1,2,3,4,5].length)

// you dont execute properties, you access them with the .
//console.log(numbers.length()) // common mistake to make
