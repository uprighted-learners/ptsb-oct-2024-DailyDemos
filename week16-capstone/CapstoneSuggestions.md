# Picking a Component Library

To save time, you can pick a component library to create a better UI faster.  
There are many libraries out there to use. Many of the better ones require TypeScript, which will be a learning curve to use.

## 3rd Party Library Use

- Sometimes you may need to bring in other 3rd party packages.
- Scan the package with [npmpackage.info](https://npmpackage.info).
- Generally, don’t use a package if you don’t need to.
- Use packages that:
  - Are well-maintained.
  - Have lots of downloads.
  - Have recent releases.
  - Have a strong community.

# Setup a Discord Group

- Communication is key between the group.

# Step Up and Do the Work

- This is a team effort. How much work you bring to the table and being transparent with your team builds trust.
- This capstone and the work you put into it as an individual is key to your success in your career.
- It reflects your current ability, effort, and dedication and will show as you enter the job market.
- Try to do full-stack work unless you are planning to specialize in a specific area (like frontend or backend).
